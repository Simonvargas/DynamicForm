# Liferaft Frontend takehome

   ```

      ```npm
      npm install || npm i
      ```
3. Open up two terminals

    ```
    npm start one terminal
    python server.py the other
    ```
4. Begin the fun!

## Areas for improvement

1. Local storage was not implemented due to time constraint but I've implemented before in other apps.

2. Styling can be better and more user friendly.

3. back button does not go back to previous form yet but you can navigate back and forth via the buttons.

4. Extra mailing address are not yet added to be posted, but that is a quick fix.

5. Due to time constraint, code is not organized. Components folder should be created and the code should have been spread out via different components for more readability.

6. When form is submitted, "application submitted" should be rendered or redirected somewhere.

7. Error handling can be added via frontend to prevent the user from proceeding to the next step and informing them what to fix.
